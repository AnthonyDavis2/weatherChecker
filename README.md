<h1>Weather Checking Website</h1>
<h3>Developed a weather forecast website using <em><strong>OpenWeatherMap API</strong></em> Retrieving JSON object which should be used to display weather on website. Website should be able to search the weather in a particular city and display today's weather along with the next four days. Background of the webpage changes based off the weather.</h3>
